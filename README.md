# Kaggle competition - [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

This repository explores various machine learning strategies for the Kaggle competition - "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques"


## Introduction

The 7 steps of machine learning as decribed [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-7-steps-of-machine-learning-2877d7e5548e) are:


- Step 1: Data collection. 
When participating in a Kaggle competition, this step is already completed for you.

- Step 2: Data preparation
Deal with missing values, outliers, duplicates, categorical data. The features needs to be normalized, selected and/or engineering and errors and bias need to be removed. Exploratory data analysis and visualisation of the data can help to identify patterns.

- Step 3: Select a model
The model chosen depends on the data. A more complex model does not always constitute a better model.

- Step 4: Train the model
Fit the model to detect patterns in the training data.

- Step 5: Evaluate the model
Use a validation dataset to assess how well a trained model performs on unseen data.

- Step 6: Hyperparameters tuning
Tune parameters to get better performance on the validation dataset.

- Step 7: Generate predictions


## The competition


### Goal
It is your job to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable. 

### Metric
Submissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price. (Taking logs means that errors in predicting expensive houses and cheap houses will affect the result equally.)

### Features and target variable

SalePrice - the property's sale price in dollars. This is the target variable that you're trying to predict.
